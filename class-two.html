             <h1>Practice Makes Perfect!</h1>
             <p>To become good at coding, it requires practice. My mother always
             told me that practice makes perfect.</p>
             <p>This is an important rule of thumb to live by in all new
               ventures in life.</p>
             <h2>Ways to Improve</h2>
            <p>This is another part of my article.</p>
        </section>

          <aside>It may interest the reader to note other life lessons and
            advice given to by my mother over time, including:
              <ul>
                 <li>Always eat your vegetables</li>
                 <li>Laughter is good for the soul</li>
                 <li>Always get a manicure before a job interview</li>
              </ul>
